        "Message": "Hola! My name is Arjay Marigondon, and I'm currently a third-year BS in Information Technology student at Forbes College Legazpi. I'm passionate about prototyping and designing for web development. I have some knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and my favorite programming language, PHP. I also enjoy working with SQL as a database. I chose BSIT as my primary course because I'm endlessly curious about modern technology. I'm fascinated by how the internet and computers work, how computers read our code, and much more. HAHA"
